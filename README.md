# odin-recipes

This is my first coding project to have completed in TOP. If I am being honest this is my first coding project in general. 

I will be using this project to showcase my newly founded skills in HTML. including, Element structure, proper use of attributes within those elements, using absolute and relative links, and the creativity that this allows. This project will consist of me compiling files into a well organized system to allow the viewer of my website to navigate between links, images, and information. 

I will create a website that showcases a few different recipes that I have gathered from friends, family, and strangers. I hope you enjoy browsing through my work and if not maybe try one of these delicious meals to sooth your frustration. 

I look forward to glancing back at this beginning work to see how much progress I have made in the future. Enjoy.
