            <li>Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs (1.5 lbs)</li>
            <li>All-Purpose Soy Sauce (1/3 Cup) </li>
            <li>White Vinager (1/3 Cup)</li>
            <li>Ground Black Pepper (1 Tbsp)</li>
            <li>Garlic Cloves, minced (6 cloves)</li>
            <li>Bay Leaves (2 leaves)</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, black pepper, minced garlic, and bay leaves. Add the chicken thighs and marinate for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and brown the chicken thighs on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Once browned, pour the reserved marinade and water into the skillet. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid and let the sauce reduce for another 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Serve the adobo chicken hot, garnished with chopped green onions. Enjoy it with steamed rice or your favorite side dish.</li>
