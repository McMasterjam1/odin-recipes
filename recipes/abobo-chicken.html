    <h2>Never say <strong>NO</strong> to Adobo</h2>
    <p>Adobo is a traditional Filipino dish that is <em>loved</em> for its savory and tangy flavors. This recipe features chicken thighs marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and spices, then simmered until tender. Serve it with steamed rice for a comforting meal.<br> <br>Adobo chicken has been my family's go-to dish for years and I hope that you will enjoy it as much as we do. </p
